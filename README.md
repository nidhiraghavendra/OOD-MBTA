## PROBLEM STATEMENT

MBTA portal system is a revamped application which allows users and administrators to manage and access Transportation facilities. The application allows the users to access Electronic travel passes for their commute, ability to recharge cards, check scheduled routes of public transport and book car rides from source to destination. The application system is developed using Java, Java FX, File I/O and the class design pattern followed is a Singleton pattern. A static instance of one driver application system object is used to store and maintain the data throughout the instance of execution.
The system incorporates Graphs, Adjacency lists, 2D Matrix to calculate route and ride information along with QR code generation for each user accountâ€™s travel passes. Object Oriented Principles are followed with Inheritance, Interfaces, Abstract class implementation, static variables and methods and Classes.


## SOLUTION
The problem statement we are addressing is in the current scenario, a customer needs to obtain a physical card or pass to travel publicly or have dollar notes to be able to pay for the commute. The customers are not allowed to travel in case of insufficient balance in the card or unable to pay in cash. First time users need not always start travel at a station that provides the card or one-time ticket. Our solution aims to provide an electronic travel ticket that can be scanned at the entrance. In the current scenario, the routes are changing due to city planning and other governmental amendments. 
Customers are notified of these changes when they arrive at a station. Our application tackles these problems. 
Customers with a disability or not, can book a public ride for cheaper rates as compared to Uber/Lyft.


## FEATURES
The Portal includes features such as:
- User Account management for customers and administrators
